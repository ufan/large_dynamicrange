\section{}
Comment 1: First of all, let me comment on the title of the submitted paper. More than a "read-out unit", the paper simply describe the "read-out" of the PSD detector. There is no "unit" mentioned in the paper. I suggest to change the title accordingly.

Comment 2: The paper needs careful english language revisions. Lot of errors, bad phrasing, inaccurate wording can be found throughout the text (se, e.g., line 1 "Paricle", also in the abstract, line 3 "study" instead of "studies", line 14 "lights" instead of "light", line 16 "these" instead of "this", etc.). The authors should have the manuscript reviewed by an english mother-tongue scientist.

Comment 3: Line 40: The reference to AMS-02 test beam results is a bit outdated. More recent data can be found in V. Bindi et al., "Calibration and performance of the AMS-02 time of flight detector in space", NIM-A, 743 (2014) 22-29. I suggest the authors to use formula (12) and Fig. 11 therein to describe the light yield saturation for heavy nuclei.

Comment 4: Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7: Authors should avoid to put text in the figure. Details about curves and/or markers should be put in the caption.

Comment 5: Table 1: Parameters are poorly described. Measurements with 40Ar refer to DY5, measurements with MIPs refers to DY8; Calibration is (ADC channels)/fC, etc.s

First, we have made some modifications based on the review's comments, listed point-by-point as follows:
1. The title has been changed to "The large dynamic range readout design of the plastic scintillator detector of DAMPE".

2. The article has underwent a careful language revision. Errors have been corrected and Inaccurate words and bad phrases have been replaced.  And ambiguous expressions and sentences have been modified and reorganized to clarify the opinion. 
Most of these modifications are trivial, modifications which need special attention are summarized below:
     (1) Original line 28, current line 33:  " \gamma=5 " corrected to "\beta\gamma=5"
     (2) The second and third paragraph of Section 2 are combined into one paragraph, because they're both related to the same subject.
     (3) In the first paragraph of Section 3.1: added more descriptions about VA160 to help readers understand the charge measurement process
     (4) Eq (3) has been corrected from "Qn-1 - Qn" to "Qn - Qn-1"
     (5) In the first paragraph of Section 4: added some description about the electronic calibration.
     (6) In the second paragraph of Section 4.1: added a sentence about the test configuration ,a sentence explaining the reason for using Dy8 to display the MIP response, also the formulas for the lower limit and covering range calculation and the calculation results.
     (7) Eq (5) corrected: added a minus sign, i.e. "(2L-x)" to "-(2L-x)"
     (8) In the 4th paragraph of Section 4.1: added the formula for the upper limit calculation, the results are re-calculated and presented for the two sides of the PSD module instead of one. We have included the calibration parameter in the calculation to covert the ADC counts into charge which was ignored by mistake in the previous edition. So the new figures are more accurate than the previous ones.
     (9) The second paragraph of Section 4.2 is too long, so it is split into two paragraphs to make the description more concise : one for presenting the test results and the other one for the analysis based on test results.  
     (10) In the third paragraph Section 4.2: added the formula for calculating the light yield of Ar in the unit of MIP, the largest signal of Ca in PSD bar is re-calculated and  presented for both sides instead of one.
      

3. The recommended article (NIM-A, 743 (2014) 22-29) is an excellent resource and the formula (12) in this article do give us a new sight on the modeling of the heavy ion response. However, the article does not list the values of the fitting parameters of formula (12). And the Y-axis of Fig. 11 uses log coordinate which brings large errors when determining the data points by hand. We can't get the exact values needed for the dynamic range estimation based on this article. So, our estimation in the paper is still based on the old article, but we have added the new article as a reference.

4. Description texts about the curves and marks have been removed from the these figures and put into the caption accordingly. But the statistical/fitting boxes of the histograms are retained because they are usually considered as part of the figure.

5. To make it more clear, the original Table 1 has been split into three new tables based on their contents: a table for the electronic  calibration result, a table for the cosmic ray test result and a table for the Ar beam test result. Description about these parameters have been added in the corresponding paragraphs. Each parameter has also been represented by a dedicated symbol to help description in the text.
