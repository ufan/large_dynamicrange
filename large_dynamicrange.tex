\begin{abstract}

A Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD), consisting of individual 82 organic plastic scintillator strips with 1 cm thick,
located at the top of DAMPE (DArk Matter Particle Explore), has been developed. It mainly serves as anti-coincidence
detector, also as a charge detector to measure cosmic ray nuclei up to charge $Z=20$. A large dynamic range from \SI{0.1}{MIPs} to \SI{1400}{MIPs} has been deduced after consideration various contributions. Integrating of a PMT with double dynodes
readout and an ASIC chip VA160, a large dynamic readout system has been presented. A cosmic ray muons and an
accelerator beam test have been used to verify this design, respectively. The results show that the readout system
could satisfy the required dynamic range.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Many space experiments aim to fundamental physics research in the universe by observation of the high energy cosmic
rays, such as the ATIC balloon-borne experiment [1], the satellite-based experiment of PAMELA [2] and the AMS-02
experiment [3]. DAMPE is a satellite-borne apparatus in the framework of Strategic Pioneer Research Program in Space
Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The main scientific objective of DAMPE is to identify possible Dark
Matter signatures by measuring high energy electrons, as well as in new discoveries in high energy gamma astronomy. It
has also great potential to study how high energy cosmic rays origin and acceleration, and how they propagate. The
DAMPE detector is designed to cover a broad energy range. It will provide high energy resolution spectra
of electron, positron, proton, helium nuclei and other heavy ions in the energy band from 10GeV to 1PeV.

In the design of the satellite-borne apparatus DAMPE, a detector sensitive to nuclear charge Z that has a large area,
sufficient light yield and charge resolution should be developed to measure relativistic cosmic-ray nuclei. Organic
plastic scintillators are ideally suited for this task. A PSD, located at the top of DAMPE, is one of the key
sub-detectors of the DAMPE and completely designed and built at the Institute of Modern Physics, CAS. Its main goals
are to serves as an anti-coincidence detector to distinguish electrons and gamma rays, also as a charge detector to
measure cosmic ray composition for elements from hydrogen (Z=1) to calcium (Z=20). The PSD consists of individual 82
organic plastic scintillator strips and covers an overall active area of 82 cm×82 cm. The scintillator strips, with a
dimension of 884 mm×28 mm×10 mm, are parallel to each other in one direction layer and aligned perpendicularly to the
two layers. To avoid the presence of any ineffective detection area, the strips at the same layer are staggered by 0.8
cm. A scintillator typed EJ-200 [5], produced by Texas Eljen Corporation, has been adopted to the PSD. Each module is
connected to a PMT Hamamatsu R4443MOD2 which is a modified version of R4443 [6], via a silicon rubber EJ-560 at each
end [5]. To improve scintillation light collection efficiency and uniformity, each scintillator strip is wrapped in
Tyvek 1056D produced by Dupont [7], and then covered with for black Polyvinyl chloride tube to light tightness. 

In this paper, we report on the design of a large dynamic range readout system for the segmented scintillators at the
PSD to challenge for measuring the energy spectra of the abundant nuclei with Z${\leq}$20 and the identifying electrons
and gamma rays. A cosmic ray and a beam test have been done to verify whether this design could cover such a dynamic
range of energy deposition measurements.

\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

Many contributions would enlarge the required dynamic range. The energy deposition in the organic plastic scintillator
and its scintillation efficiency is one of the most important contribution to the required dynamic range. When minimum
ionizing particles (MIPs) passing through 1 cm thick scintillator strip they release a certain amount of energy. This
value is about 2 MeV[7], defined as 1 MIPs. For a charge particle much heavier than electron the specific ionization
energy loss is well parameterized by the famous Bethe-Bloch formula. The mean rate of energy loss increases with the
charged number Z of the relativistic incident particle. However, the dependence of light output from energy deposition
is usually nonlinear in organic plastic scintillator. A relationship between the response of the scintillator to a
charged particle and the specific energy loss is well modeled by Briks-Chou law [8,9]. 

In order to know the quantitative information on the light output response of organic plastic scintillator to energetic
heavy ions at relativistic energies, many experiments investigate this nonlinear effect [10,11,12]. The maximum energy
deposition in 1 cm thick scintillator strip at the PSD is about 270 MIPs from the charge of cosmic rays nuclei up to
Z=20 when they travelling through the detector medium vertically. Moreover, a field view of DAMPE will determine the
maximum length of incident charged particle, and this energy deposition is about 540 MIPs as the max incident
inclination angle is approximately 60\textsuperscript{o}.

Another contribution to the dynamic range of the energy deposition is the light attenuation in a long scintillator
strip. In the case where a specific geometry and a wrapping material are given to the scintilltor strips at the PSD,
the light attenuation is definite. After selection of the scintillator strip, a reduction ratio in the intensity of the
scintillation light is hoped to smaller than 50\% as the incident particle hit the middle position perpendicularly.
Since two charge measurements are carried on with the PMTs placed in both sides of a given strip and these two PMTs are
reserved for each other, a mean rate of energy deposition range from 0.5 MIPs to 1080 MIPs at least is required for
cosmic ray nuclei from Z=1 up to Z=20.

The fluctuation of energy loss by ionization of a charged particle in a thin scintillator is also taken into account.
Assumption the energy resolution of the fluctuation is 10\% ($\sigma $), a maximum measurable energy deposition per
scintillator strip up to 1350 MIPs is required as a 5$\sigma $ width is accepted, while a minimum value down to 0.25
MIPs is required at least. Therefore, a readout system for each PSD unit covering a dynamic range from 0.1 MIPs to 1400
MIPs could meet all requirements.

It’s difficult to read out a signal in such a wide range by using only one front-end electronics (FEE) circuit. There
are several ways to achieve a high dynamic readout were reported [13,14,15]. To measure the energy deposition in the
range with 4 orders of magnitude at each plastic scintillator strip of PSD, a readout system that uses a PMT with
double dynode outputs coupled to FEE with an ASIC chip has been developed and performed. A low power consumption ASIC
chip known as VA160, which can be seen as a modified version of the VA32-HDR14.2, developed by IDEAS (Norway) [16], is
used as the FEE for the PSD. This VA160 chip is optimized for positive input signals for the PMT dynodes output, and
the analog to digital conversion is performed by a 14-bit ADC. The saturation level is about 12 pC, and the RMS noise
of this chip is \~{}0.8 fC.

Among the PSD, those of the lower dynamic range 0.1 MIPs will be need to measure. An input noise of the PSD whole system
about 6 fC is expected for the detection of the incident particles. To distinguish signal from noise clearly, a
5$\sigma $ separation of the detector pedestal is required, so we can deduce that 1 MIPs energy deposition should be
better to set to \~{}300 fC. Thus a dynamic range from 0.1 MIPs to 40 MIPs can be achieved for one electronic channel.
This dynamic range could not cover the total required dynamic range, so a PMT with double dynodes readout is
indispensible. Fig.~\ref{fig:readout_scheme} shows the combination of dual-gain photo devices and VA160 chip per each scintillator channel.
It’s shown that the signals from the same PMT are sent to different VA160 chip separately to reduce the crosstalk
between the two dynodes.

As MIPs penetrating a long strip, the efficiency of light transmission is limited by total reflection angle, and that
not more than 22.5\% fraction of scintillation light would reach the two ends of the strip. Taking into account that
the scintillator EJ-200 generates one photon for every 100 eV of deposited energy, we can calculate the number of
photon electrons (PEs) collected by one end of PMT as MIPs penetrating 1 cm thick strip in the middle point from
Eq.~\ref{eq:pecalculation}.

\begin{equation}
 N_{PEs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\SI[per-mode=symbol]{2}{\mega\electronvolt\per\centi\meter}}{\SI{100}{\electronvolt}} \times 0.225
           \times \varepsilon_{1} \times \varepsilon_{2} \times \varepsilon_{3} \times \varepsilon_{4} \times \SI{1}{\centi\meter}
        \approx \SI{45}{PEs/mip}
\label{eq:pecalculation}
\end{equation} 

Where $\varepsilon $\textsubscript{1} is the reduction ratio related to the intensity of the scintillation light between
the hit position and the end of the strip, and this value is controlled to smaller than 50\%. The value of$\varepsilon
$\textsubscript{2}, corresponding to the quantum efficiency of the readout PMT, is about 0.15. The
parameter$\varepsilon $\textsubscript{3 }is the transmission ratio of a 3 mm thick silicon rubber optical interface,
and this value is approximately 0.9. The last parameter $\varepsilon $\textsubscript{4 }is determined by the geometry
efficiency, which is the ratio of the effective photocathode area of the readout device and the cross section of the
scintillator strip , and the calculated value is approximately 0.3.


The chosen PMT R4443MOD2, composed of 10 stage dynodes, has a gain factor of 1×10\textsuperscript{6} at the supply high
voltage of 1000V, which is obviously too high for the VA160 chip. Using the standard voltage divider and supply voltage
from Hamamatsu, a simple calculation to obtain the multiplication factor of the two adjacent dynodes is 4. To match the
dynamic range of VA160, the signal from the middle dynodes is extracted to reduce the gain factor of the PMT. The 8th
dynode (Dy8), with a gain of 6×10\textsuperscript{4} from a rough calculation at given standard voltage, is the optimal
selection to test the MIPs signals. The positive charge outputs from Dy8 is 450 fC, which is a little larger than our
expectation 300 fC, and the difference can be eliminated easily by fine adjustment of the supply high voltage of the
PMTs. To cover the required upper dynamic range, an earlier stage 5th dynode (Dy5) is used to the larger signals
measurements, as the relative gain factor across three dynodes is 64 at standard supply voltage from a simple
calculation. Since the operating voltage is smaller than the standard voltage, the relative gain of Dy8/Dy5 is expected
to 50±15 times. Assumption the relative gain between the two dynodes is 35 times, then the Dy5 will cover an energy
range from 3.5 MIPs to 1400 MIPs. Therefore, the total readout system could achieve the demanded wide range of 4
orders, and also provide a cross calibration between the two dynodes. Figure 2 shows the circuit diagram of the PMT
divider. It’s shown that the voltage distribution across the dynodes is the same. To improve the output linearity of
the input pulse, decoupling capacitors are connected to the last few stages using a parallel mode. To protect the high
voltage power, two capacitors in series are used in the output of dynodes.

\section{Tests Result}
\label{sec:result}

\subsection{Test with Cosmic Ray}
\label{sec:cosmicray}

Cosmic ray muons are the most numerous energetic charged at sea level with a mean energy of about 4 GeV, and are
typically MIPs. As muons penetrating orthogonally in 1 cm scintillator, the amount of energy around 1 MIPs leaves on
average per unit length. So a cosmic ray muons test was used to study the MIPs response at the laboratory. The layout
of the test setup for a scintillator strip with cosmic ray muons is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_test}. Two small trigger, with the
dimension of \ 1.0×1.0×1.0 cm\textsuperscript{3}, also made with scintillator are fixed on a movable support to
investigate the performance of the readout system, and point-by-point measurement has been carried out. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:mip} shows a typical MIPs energy spectrum read out from Dy8. The amplitude spectrum has an asymmetric form with a
longer right-hand tail which is characteristic for thin absorbers. The most probable amplitude of the distribution
characterizing mean energy losses for MIPs is obtained by fitting a Landau function to the spectrum as shown in Figure
4. The most probable value of MIPs signals is 396.5 ADC counts. It’s approximately 320 fC when the ADC count is
converted into charge. The amplitude distribution of the pedestal for each signal channel is also shown in Figure 4.
From the Figure, we can find that the input noise of the whole PSD system is approximate 3 fC, which is merely half of
the expected value. As a result of 0.1 MIPs signals, the most probable value of the signal-to-noise of the PSD system
is greater than 10, and this value is exceeding the expected requirement for a 5$\sigma $ separation from the whole PSD
detector pedestal.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{mip}
\caption{The pulse height distribution of cosmic muons from a low gain channel Dy8.}
\label{fig:mip}
\end{figure} 

The light attenuation of the scintillator strip could not be negligible for the required dynamic range. Fig.~\ref{fig:attenuation} shows
the charge amplitude at various locations along the scintillator strip, and it’s found that the amplitude is well
fitted by an exponent fit. In the figure, the charge amplitude at different hit locations is scaled to the middle hit
position. It’s shown that the amplitude of charge pulse is not independent on the hit position. From the fitting data,
the ratio between the nearest and the farthest hit position from the same readout PMT is not greater than 4, so it is
not beyond the former desired value. 

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{attenuation}
\caption{The charge pulse amplitude at different hit positions along the tested scintillator strip.}
\label{fig:attenuation}
\end{figure} 

The charge ratio of a low gain channel Dy8 and a high gain channel Dy5 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dy58}. From figure, the charge
collection of the Dy8 reach the maximum dynamic range of the VA160, and the saturation level is found to be about 12
pC. From a linearity fit, the relative gain for Dy8/Dy5 of 44.6 could be derived, so the upper dynamic range of about
1670 MIPs can be obtained from a calculation using Eq.~\ref{eq:range}.
\begin{equation}
 Range_{upper} = k_{e}(Dy8/Dy5)
 \label{eq:range}
\end{equation} 
Where $k_e$ is the VA160 charge dynamic range, and the adopted upper range of VA160 is 12
pC. Apparently, the required upper dynamic range1400 MIPs could be covered by our design.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{dy58}
\caption{The correlation between the signals in a low gain channel Dy8 and a high gain Dy5.}
\label{fig:dy58}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Test with Ion Beam}
\label{sec:beam}

A scintillator strip of PSD were tested at CERN SPS ion beam facility to verify our design to the required upper dynamic
range. A primary of \textsuperscript{40}Ar (Z=18) was accelerated to 40 A GeV/c, and the charge of Argon crossing the
scintillator strip was measured by looking at its energy loss. The most probable value and the sigma of energy
deposition from a relativistic Argon beam are about 217 MIPs and 4.2\% in the Fig.~\ref{fig:Ar}, respectively. A linear
extrapolation is used to obtain the energy deposition for the Calcium (Z=20), and the most probable energy deposition
for PSD scintillator strip is 268 MIPs from a calculation. Since the quenching effect existing, the actual energy
deposition is a little smaller than 268 MIPs, and this value is not out of our former estimation. Assumption the sigma
of energy deposition is 5\%, the upper limit of the amplitude of the charge pulse is 1340 MIPs as the incident Calcium
particles cross the scintillator strip with the largest field view of DAMPE and a 5$\sigma $ energy fluctuation is
considered for the nearer readout PMT. This value is within the limits of our design.

\end{figure} 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclustion}

A broad energy dynamic range of 0.1 MIPs\~{}1400 MIPs required for each PSD has been deduced from a number of
contributions, including energy deposition of nuclei up to charge Z\~{}20, light attenuation, particle incidence angle
and fluctuation of energy loss. A readout system that used a PMT with double dynodes output coupled to FEE with a chip
VA160 optimized for positive polarity signals has been developed and used to measure the energy deposition in a
scintillator strip. Cosmic ray muons were used to investigate the influence of scintillation light attenuation, MIPs
peak and the equivalent noise of the whole detector system. The input noise of the whole PSD system is approximately 3
fC, and the most probable value of the signal-to-noise is greater than 10 for the lower signals with 0.1 MIPs energy
deposition. It’s also found that the required upper dynamic range1400 MIPs could be covered by our design easily. A
relativistic argon beam test has been also used to verify the design. Once again the result shows that the readout
system could satisfy the large dynamic range requirements.
